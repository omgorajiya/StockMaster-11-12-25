Step 1: Activate your Python virtual environment

This ensures all your Python packages are isolated for this project.

cd "D:\StockMaster project\backend"
venv\Scripts\activate

{	OUT-PUT:
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26200.7171]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

D:\StockMaster project\backend>venv\Scrpits\activate
The system cannot find the path specified.

D:\StockMaster project\backend>venv\Scripts\activate

(venv) D:\StockMaster project\backend>	}


You should see (venv) at the start of your terminal line.


Step 2: Install all Python dependencies

If you haven’t already or if you cloned a fresh repo:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Step 3: Apply migrations

Django uses migrations to sync your models with the database. Run:

python manage.py migrate

{	OUT-PUT:
(venv) D:\StockMaster project\backend>python manage.py migrate
D:\StockMaster project\backend\venv\Lib\site-packages\rest_framework_simplejwt\__init__.py:1: UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html. The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30. Refrain from using this package or pin to Setuptools<81.
  from pkg_resources import DistributionNotFound, get_distribution
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: accounts, admin, auth, contenttypes, operations, products, sessions
Running migrations:
  No migrations to apply.

(venv) D:\StockMaster project\backend>	}


✅ This ensures your SQLite database is up-to-date.


Step 4: Run Django development server

Start your backend server:

python manage.py runserver

{	OUT-PUT:

(venv) D:\StockMaster project\backend>python manage.py runserver
D:\StockMaster project\backend\venv\Lib\site-packages\rest_framework_simplejwt\__init__.py:1: UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html. The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30. Refrain from using this package or pin to Setuptools<81.
  from pkg_resources import DistributionNotFound, get_distribution
D:\StockMaster project\backend\venv\Lib\site-packages\rest_framework_simplejwt\__init__.py:1: UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html. The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30. Refrain from using this package or pin to Setuptools<81.
  from pkg_resources import DistributionNotFound, get_distribution

Django version 3.2.25, using settings 'stockmaster.settings'

Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK		}


The server runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You can open this in a browser to check it’s working.

Leave this terminal open while working on the project.



Step 5: Run your Next.js frontend

Open another terminal, go to your frontend folder, e.g.,

cd "D:\StockMaster project\frontend"
npm install     # Only first time or if new dependencies are added

{	OUT-PUT:
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26200.7171]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

D:\StockMaster project\frontend>npm install

up to date, audited 421 packages in 3s

140 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

1 critical severity vulnerability

To address all issues, run:
  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.

D:\StockMaster project\frontend>	}

npm run dev

{	OUT-PUT:
D:\StockMaster project\frontend>npm run dev

> stockmaster-frontend@1.0.0 dev
> next dev

   ▲ Next.js 14.0.4
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
   - Environments: .env.local

 ✓ Ready in 2.6s	}


This starts Next.js at http://localhost:3000/

Now your frontend can talk to Django backend at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/....


Step 6: Check CORS (if frontend fails to fetch)

In Django settings.py, make sure:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'corsheaders',
    ...
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
    ...,
]

CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",
]

Step 7: Done!

Open frontend: http://localhost:3000

Open backend: http://127.0.0.1:8000
 (for API check)

Your project is now running smoothly!
